This version of playsid.library provides three different sound
output methods:

- The original SID emulation by Per Sundell & Ron Birk
- The reSID emulation engine by Dag Lem
- SIDBlaster-USB, a device that uses a SID chip for sound

To use, copy "playsid.library" into LIBS:, replacing the original
version. By default it will use the original SID emulation mode.

To select the output mode, set the environment variable "PlaySIDMode"
to a number, eg. 'setenv PlaySIDMode 1', where the numbers are:
0 = Original
1 = reSID 6581
2 = reSID 8580
3 = SIDBlaster USB

Applications using "playsid.library" will automatically be enhanced.
These are at least HippoPlayer and DeliTracker. 

HippoPlayer also provides additional integration in the user interface: 
output mode selection, volume setting, scope display. With Hippo 
the environment variable setting is not used.


reSID
-----

reSID provides an accurate, cycle exact emulation of both the 6581 
and the 8580 SID chips, with filter support. 

reSID is very heavy on the CPU. I measured CPU usage of 50-80% on 
my A1200/060, depending on the tune. Your system may become unresponsive 
if it's not powerful enough. An FPU is not required. A 68040 
will probably not be fast enough.

reSID is updated at 200 Hz, this should allow double and quad speed 
SID tunes to work acceptably.

Samples will not be heard. This is because the samples have typically 
had some special handling in SID players and emulators. The 
playsid.library sample handling is not used with reSID.

Sometimes the sound output may be noisy. This is sampling noise, 
result of the reSID "fast sampling" method. Unfortunately the 
better quality sampling options available in reSID are too slow 
for a 50 MHz 68060 so they have been left out.

SIDBlaster
----------

SIDBlaster is a USB device that can utilize an actual SID chip
and allow playback using it, providing a truly authentic sound. 
In addition to some extra hardware and USB connectivity, 
the Poseidon USB stack needs to be installed.
